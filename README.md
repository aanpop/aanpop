## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner
I'm a political science explorer by trade, interested in Quantitative IR (and general political science) using Python.
  
## Whatâ€™s Cooking in My Brain?
Currently I'm PhD-ing my way through IR while exploring Python as my trusty sidekick - not as an expert yet. Still learning, but always amazed. 
I'm exploring it for analyzing the political dynamics that shape our world. Like having a digital Swiss Army knife for research. And yes, it does work wonders even for qualitative analysis (who knew?).

## Current Interests

- Conflict & Cooperation Analysis
- Quantitative IR
- Python for Data Science (Still figuring out the ropes, but excited to break things and learn)
- And always looking for new ways to stir the data pot in political science.
